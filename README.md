# OS DISK FREE

just a simple command tool to visualize how much disk 
you have left and how much is used by the swap 
(which is a problem in OSX). 
so you know if you need to restart your computer or not..

also, it shows the desired folders' main files, so you can find
and eliminate easily the *folders* inside a file that
take too much space.

feel free to copy or modify.
